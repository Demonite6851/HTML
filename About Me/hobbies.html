                <li>I like to read a bit in my spare time, and sometimes I lose track of time because of it.</li>
                <li>Like most teenagers, gaming is a natural hobby of mine.</li>
                <li>I play baseball in the summertime, and I enjoy it a lot.</li>
                <li>Sometimes, I like to spend time coding random things in Python. Unfortunately, I usually delete whatever I make due to a loss of interest.</li>
                <li>I love doing things that require assembly like Lego or VEX robotics.</li>
