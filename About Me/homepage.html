                <li>I go to Nora Frances Henderson Secondary School, and am in Grade 11.</li>
                <li>I have ASD and ADHD, so I sometimes struggle to maintain focus and interest in other people and conversations.</li>
                <li>My birthday is December 10th, and I do not like how close to Christmas it is.</li>
                <li>I have a brother and a sister, who are both older than me.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>When I am given a task to do, I focus on it so hard its sometimes hard to get me to stop.</li>
                <li>I am moderately skilled in programming, mainly focusing on Python.</li>
                <li>I am able to work indepentently for long periods of time. In fact, that is usually where I thrive.</li>
                <li>I try and tackle problems in a variety of ways, mainly focusing on quality rather than efficiency.</li>
                <li>I am able to work on a team very well as I try not to obstruct other people and help only when asked.</li>
                <li>I like to organize what I'm doing and break down large problems into several smaller ones.</li>
                <li>I don't like to fight with people as confrontations stress me out.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>I like to read a bit in my spare time, and sometimes I lose track of time because of it.</li>
                <li>Like most teenagers, gaming is a natural hobby of mine.</li>
                <li>I play baseball in the summertime, and I enjoy it a lot.</li>
                <li>Sometimes, I like to spend time coding random things in Python. Unfortunatetly, I usually delete whatever I make due to a loss of interest.</li>
                <li>I love doing things that require assembly like Lego or VEX robotics.</li>
            </ul>
