                <li>I am Spencer Langdon. I am 15 years old.</li>
                <li>I go to Nora Frances Henderson Secondary School, and am in Grade 11.</li>
                <li>I have ASD and ADHD, so I sometimes struggle to maintain focus and interest in other people and conversations.</li>
                <li>My birthday is December 10th, and I do not like how close to Christmas it is.</li>
                <li>I have a brother and a sister, who are both older than me.</li>
                <li>I speak English, and a very very small bit of French.</li>
